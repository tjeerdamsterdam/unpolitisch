###Data driven insights in policy, economics and politics.

This repository constitutes what I have learned from the courses Harvard Data Science and Economics courses, MITx 'The Analytics Edge' and Duke University 'Data Analysis and Statistical Inference'. This websites aims to be my platform to publish some of my own data science exercises and to publish course related work. I plan on finishing the Harvard Data Science certificate in 2016. And hopefully obtain a Harvard Master degree in Software Engineering / Computational Economics in 2017.
